# Hotel Management ReAct Agent

This project is a LangChain-powered ReAct agent that interacts with a hotel management SQLite database using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenAI-compatible API.

## Features

- üí° Intelligent querying using a Gemini-powered agent
- üîç Read table structure and query data conditionally
- üõ†Ô∏è Uses LangChain tools for modular DB interaction
- üîí Safe read-only queries (no insert/update/delete)
- üóÉÔ∏è SQLite backend with realistic schema and sample data
- üìä Specialized tools for hotel analytics and insights
- üë• Customer tracking with name and booking history

## Files

- `setup.py`: Creates `hotel.db` with schema and dummy data.
- `tools.py`: LangChain tools for reading records, describing tables, and running specialized hotel queries.
- `agent.py`: ReAct agent using Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite via OpenAI SDK.
- `.env`: Required environment variables (not included in repo).
- `setup.sh`: Interactive setup script for macOS/Linux.
- `setup.bat`: Interactive setup script for Windows.

## Quick Setup (Recommended)

### For macOS/Linux Users:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### For Windows Users:
```
setup.bat
```

The interactive setup script will:
1. Check if Python is installed
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install all required dependencies
4. Guide you through creating a Google Gemini API key if you don't have one
5. Set up your `.env` file securely
6. Initialize the database with sample data
7. Let you test a query right away

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually, follow these steps:

### 1. Get a Google Gemini API Key

1. Visit the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account
2. Click on "Get API key" in the navigation menu
3. Create a new API key (or use an existing one)
4. Copy the API key - you'll need it for your `.env` file
5. **Important**: Keep your API key secure! Never commit it to version control or share it publicly

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install langchain langgraph langchain-openai python-dotenv sqlite3
```

### 3. Create a `.env` file

Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory with the following content:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
SQLITE_DB_PATH=hotel.db
```

Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with the actual API key you obtained.

**Security Warning**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control or share it with others. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### 4. Run the database setup

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will create the SQLite database with sample data for testing.

### 5. Query the agent

Example usage:

```python
from agent import agent
response = agent.invoke({"input": "List all vacant 2BHK rooms."})
print(response["output"])
```

## Available Specialized Tools

The system includes several specialized tools for hotel analytics:

- **Room Management**: Find vacant rooms by type
- **Guest Movement**: Track upcoming arrivals and departures
- **Customer Insights**: Identify frequent customers and booking history
- **Business Intelligence**: Analyze occupancy rates and revenue performance

## Schema Overview

- `Rooms(RoomID, isVacant, currentStay, type, price)`
- `Bookings(BookingsID, customerID, bookedDate, arrivalDate, departureDay, paymentID)`
- `Customers(CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, DOB, IdentityType, IdentityString)`
- `Pricing(PaymentID, PaymentType, isDone, price, discount)`
